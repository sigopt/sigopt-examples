    "Text classification problems appear quite often in modern information systems, and you might imagine building a small document/tweet/blogpost classifier for any number of purposes. In this example, we're building a pipeline to label [Amazon product reviews](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/) as either favorable or not. First, we'll use scikit-learn to build a logistic regression classifier, performing k-fold cross validation to measure the accuracy. Next, we'll use SigOpt to tune the hyperparameters of both the feature extraction and the model building. \n",

    "## Feature Representation\n",
    "The [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) class in scikit-learn is a convenient mechanism for transforming a corpus of text documents into vectors using [bag of words representations (BOW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model). scikit-learn offers quite a bit of control in determining which [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) make up the vocabulary for your BOW vectors.  As a quick refresher, n-grams are sequences of text tokens as shown in the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Text | “SigOpt optimizes any complicated system”\n",
    "--- | ---\n",
    "1-grams | { “SigOpt”, “optimizes”, “any”, “complicated”, “system”}\n",
    "2-grams | { “SigOpt_optimizes”, “optimizes_any”, “any_complicated” ... }\n",
    "3-grams | { “SigOpt_optimizes_any”, “optimizes_any_complicated” ... }\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of times each n-gram appears in a given piece of text is then encoded in the BOW vector describing that text.  CountVectorizer allows you to control the range of n-grams that are included in the vocabulary (`ngram_range`), as well as filtering n-grams outside a specified [document-frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) range (`min_df`, `max_df`). For example, if a rare 3-gram like “hi_diddly_ho” doesn’t appear with at least `min_df` frequency in the corpus, it is not included in the vocabulary.  Similarly, n-grams that occur in nearly every document (1-grams like “the”, “a” etc) can also be filtered using the `max_df` parameter. "

    "## Objective Metric\n",
    "SigOpt finds parameter configurations that **maximize** any metric, so we need to pick one that is appropriate for this classification task. In designing our objective metric, [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision), the number of correctly classified reviews, is obviously important, but we also want assurance that our model generalizes and can perform well on data on which it was not trained.  This is where the idea of [cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) comes into play.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation requires us to split up our entire labeled dataset into two distinct sets: one to train on and one to validate our trained classifier on.  We then consider metrics like accuracy on only the validation set.  Taking this further and considering not one, but many possible splits of the labeled data is the idea of [k-fold cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_%28statistics%29#k-fold_cross-validation) where multiple training, validation sets are generated and validation metrics can be aggregated in several ways (e.g., mean, min, max) to give a single estimation of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we’ll use the mean of the k-folded cross-validation accuracies (see the [original blog post](http://blog.sigopt.com/post/133089144983/sigopt-for-ml-automatically-tuning-text) for a further discussion). In our case, k=5 folds are used and the train and validation sets are split randomly using 70% and 30% of the entire dataset, respectively."

    "As you can see, `ngram_range` is really two integer parameters, a minimum and a maximum. To tune these parameters in the classifier we tell SigOpt to tune the minimum value as an integer parameter such as `min_ngram`, in addition to an offset such as `ngram_offset`, where `max_ngram = min_ngram + ngram_offset`. We'll use this trick with parameters for both document frequency and n-grams.\n",

To transform back to the original parameter, `min_df = math.exp(log_min_df)`.\n",
